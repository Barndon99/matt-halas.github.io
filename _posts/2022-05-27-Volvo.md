## Introduction

For my capstone project (or senior design project), my team and I were tasked with developing an accurate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) design. We broke the simulation of the UAV into four parts; the external aerodynamics, intake, combustion, and nozzle. Having the UAV broken down into these four components made it easier to troubleshoot and ensure each component was giving accurate results.

An important part of ensuring the CFD analysis is accurate is validating the results of the CFD with similar experimental cases. This is done by recreating an experimental setup in the CFD solver and comparing the results to experimental results.

My focus for this project was on the engine of the UAV. For this analysis, we used a simple cylindrical engine with a flame holder blocking 40% of the combustor area. This geometry is very similar to the Volvo Afterburner common research model. The geometry for this experimental case is shown in figure 1.

## Background

More information about this validation case can be found [here](https://community.apan.org/cfs-file/__key/widgetcontainerfiles/3fc3f82483d14ec485ef92e206116d49-g-_2D00_tM6tEO4PkenM5KsnY8ctg-page-0cases/MVP2_5F00_Validation_5F00_Case_5F00_Final.pdf){:target=_blank}.

### Mesh

The geometry was recreated and meshed using ANSA. The meshed geometry is shown in figure ... A half geometry with symmetry on the bottom wall was used to save on computing time. Additionally, instead of refining the mesh near the walls, wall functions were used to approximate no-slip conditions on the walls. This method was also more compatible with the solver used for this validation. The solver uses local time stepping, which gives issues when transient effects are present, such as in the beginning of combustion.

### Solver

The reactingPimpleCentralFoam solver was used for this validation. Reacting was required for the combustion and 'pimple' combines the PISO and SIMPLE algorithms to solve the governing equaitons. This is a compressible solver, which is not necessarily required for the low velocity in the combustor, but it is required for the other components of the UAV where flow velocities closer to or at M=1 are encountered. The governing equations for this solver are as follows.
