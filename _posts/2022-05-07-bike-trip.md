In November 2020, after one (1) month of snow, I was dreaming of summer. Unfortunately, since it was only November, I'd have to wait 5 months before it would be nice and warm out again. So until then, my only option was to experience summer vicariously through youtube videos. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3O3ooTtrV4){:target="_blank"} came up on my feed so I watched it over the course of a few days while eating lunch. The Great Divide Mountain Bike Route (Banff, AB to the Mexico border) has been on my bucket list for a couple years and this video seemed to capture the experience so well. After watching the video, I knew I wanted to do a similar trip in the summer. So I started planning and I started dreaming of the upcoming trip!
## The Route
I've never done a bikepacking trip before so I wasn't about to make the GDMBR my first trip. I wanted to do something big though, so I browsed [bikepacking.com](https://www.bikepacking.com){:target="_blank"} for inspiration. After a road trip through southern BC in the previous year, I was wanting to go back, so the [BC Trail](https://bikepacking.com/routes/bc-trail/){:target="blank"} seemed like a great choice! After some more searching, I found that the [Trans Canada Trail](https://tctrail.ca/explore-the-map/){:target="blank"}(TCT) overlaps with the entire BC Trail, so I based my route off that. I decided I would leave from my house in Calgary, AB, and finish my trip at Stanley Park in Vancouver, BC.

## Planning and Gear
I read somewhere on Reddit that the best bike for bikepacking is the bike you own. I own two bikes, a Jamis Ventura road bike, and Trek Fuel mountain bike. I should have listened, but I was dead set on using a hardtail for this trip since most bikepacking videos I've seen had only hardtails or rigid bikes. My friend has a hard tail that he hasn't used for a while, so he let me borrow his Giant Talon.
<img src="images\talon-pre-trip.jpg" alt="The Giant Talon" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Giant Talon Packed up on Day 1</p>
Originally, I wanted to use a panier for the extra storage space, but the mounting would be a pain to set up so I went with the ol' reliable saddle bag. I also bought a frame bag (small enough to leave space for a water bottle), top tube bag (waterproof for electronics), and a dry bag for the handlebars. I wish I got a picture of all my gear layed out before packing (those pictures are so cool!), but I'll make sure to get that for my next trip.

I didn't want to hold myself to a schedule, so I got a good idea of where I could camp along the route and planned to stop whenever I felt that I had enough for the day. I carried a sat phone with me that I could use to check in with me mum whenever I was starting/stopping for the day.

## Day 1 - Calgary to Bragg Creek (71 km)
My friend Austin joined me for the first day, so after leaving, I biked the familiar route between our houses to pick him up. It was about 35<sup>o</sup>C when I left, so walking into Austin's air conditioned home after 20 minutes of biking made me reconsider what I was about to do. I quickly pushed that thought aside, helped Austin load up his bike, and we were on route to Bragg Creek! The route I chose for this day deviates from the Trans Canada Trail, as I didn't want to go all the way north to Cochrane just to come back down south to Bragg Creek. This was the only day that was 100% road, so I chose the least busy roads between Calgary and Bragg Creek and took those.

This route took us through rural communities and hilly ranchlands. Very hilly ranchlands. We made distance a bit slower than expected but finally made it into Bragg Creek as dusk was creeping in. We still had light to set up the tent, but we ate in the dark. I spent a good 20 minutes trying to get the bear hang set up, but after that, we were out.

## Day 2 - Bragg Creek to Barrier Lake (52 km)
The sun shining through the tent wall makes it quite difficult to sleep in. So even if we could've used a few more hours of sleep, we packed up and headed over to the town of Bragg Creek for breakfast.
<img src="images\first-campsite.jpg" alt="Tent for first night" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">Our campsite on the morning of the 2nd day</p>
I wouldn't have another spot to get food until well into day 3, so I stocked up on peanut butter, canned tuna, chocolate, pepperoni, and any other dense foods I could find. Austin biked with me to the West Bragg Creek trailhead and we waited for his mom to pick him up there. From this point on, I'd be leaving the road and biking on trails.
<img src="images\me-n-austin.jpg" alt="Tent for first night" width="40%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">Me and Austin hanging out at West Bragg Creek</p>
I was starting to get a little nervous about being on my own on the trails here, but excitement took over once I got biking. There were some super muddy sections of the trail here which made the travelling extremely slow.
<img src="images\muddy-trail.jpg" alt="Tom Snow trail" width="40%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Tom Snow trail in Bragg Creek</p>
The official TCT goes over Cox Hill, which would add another 900m of elevation to my already tired legs, so I chose to ride around it instead. I still had to go up a pass to get to Barrier Lake, and after a few hours of pushing my bike through mud and up hills, I found I was taking breaks every 5 minutes until I had to eventually sit down. This made me realize I barely ate anything since breakfast and this was but a "bonk". I had a few spoons of peanut butter, read The Alchemist for 15 minutes, and I was good to go again! I got to the top of Lusk Pass, the trail started to flatten out, and I was getting excited for the downhill. Then my back wheel went over a rock, slipped, and I found I could not pedal anymore.
<img src="images\rip-derailleur.jpg" alt="Tom Snow trail" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">The poor derailleur</p>
Oh lordy. This was not good. The derailleur was completely trashed. I tried running the chain through just the front chainring and cassette, but with no tension from the derailleur, it kept slipping as I went over bumps on the downhill. I kept imagining what I'd do to get myself out of this and keep the trip going. Canmore was still so far away and there's no way I'd do that entire stretch on one gear with a chain that slips every minute. I contemplated quitting a couple of times. But after calming down, and thinking the situation through, I decided that the Giant Talon would be a no-go for the rest of the trip. I asked me mum to bring my Trek Fuel to Barrier Lake, 45 mintues outside of Calgary. Luckily, she was okay with it. The trip was saved! While waiting at Barrier Lake, I ate some dinner, went for a swim, and had an hour to relax after all the biking and bike issues. I moved all my bags over to the new bike, asked a biker in the parking lot for a shock pump to make up for the extra weight of the bags, and was off to find a campsite on the south side of Barrier Lake.

## Day 3 - Barrier Lake to Banff (55 km)
I woke up excited that the trip could continue, and had myself a healthy and nutritious breakfast of chocolate and peanutbutter. A few foxes passing through my campsite joined me for breakfast too!
<img src="images\day3-fox.jpg" alt="Fox joining me for breakfast" width="40%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
After breakfast, I got up and back down Jewell Pass without too much hassle. The section of trail alongside the Trans-Canada Highway gave me lots of hassle though. No amount of bug spray would deter the mosquitos, and with the amount of steep sections that involved me getting off my bike and stopping for a breather, they had plenty of opportunities to bite my arms and legs.
<img src="images\day3-stairs.jpg" alt="Fox joining me for breakfast" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">The trail along the Trans-Canada Highway had plenty of these stairs. Pushing a 60lb bike up these stairs was a bit of a challenge</p>
After plenty of hike-a-biking, I made it to Canmore! I was craving a burger and fries so I headed straight for the Don's. Once again, the AC made me question why I was doing this to myself and once again I quickly pushed that thought aside. Starting on the Canmore to Banff paved pathway, I noticed a distressing grinding noise coming from my back wheel. I kept getting off my bike, trying to diagnose it but no matter what I tightened, it would keep going. I shrugged it off and decided I'd deal with it when I got to Banff. The grinding kept getting worse and worse, and soon became accompanied with a wobble. I pulled over, took the back wheel off, and tried to take apart the hub to see what the issue was. Nothing stuck out, and no matter how much I tried to tighten it, the hub still wobbled. I hobbled into Banff with the wheel screeching every rotation by the time I stopped for the day. Lucky for me (I got lucky lots this trip), I was planning on staying with my friends in Banff for two nights, so the extra day gave me plenty of time to deal with the wheel issue. I got referred to this local legend, 'Dave', who was the community bike mechanic for the town of Banff. He took a look at the wheel for me, and told me the hub would need to be rebuilt with new parts, which would take quite some time to get ordered in. He said a new wheelset was my best bet at continuing this trip. After the day prior, I was determined not to let anything stop me so I called every bike shop in the area till I found a shop in Canmore that had the wheelset I was looking for. $300 later, the trip was saved yet again! Dave wouldn't take any money or gifts for his help, but instead told me to buy his friend in Fernie some chocolate. I had a quest and I wasn't going to let Dave down!

## Day 4 - Banff to Somewhere in the Spray Valley (50 km)
While getting breakfast in Banff before starting on one of the more remote sections of the trip, I met a guy named Joe who was doing the same trip as me, but in the opposite direction. This was super reassuring since the smoke from wildfires was pretty bad this season. Seeing someone else on this route made me feel more confident about pressing through the smoke. The Goat Creek Trail paired with the High Rockies Trail in the Spray Valley gave this day some of the best biking in the entire trip.

<img src="images\day4-actionshot.jpg" alt="Action shot!" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">Pic of me after biking down once, setting up a gopro, walking back up, and biking down again</p>
While in the Spray Valley, I ran into a couple on a mountain bike ride, said hi, and biked by. 5 minutes later, I heard someone yell 'hey!' from behind me. I looked back, and it was the guy I just passed. He then asked if my name was Matt. I asked how he knew, and his girlfriend said I seemed like a Matt when I biked by. His name was Dave (I asked for his name, unfortunately I didn't guess), and him and his girlfriend visit from Ontario every year to bike this trail. He then invited me to bike ~200km from Banff to Fernie with him later in the summer. The bike ride never happened but I was intrigued! That whole interaction was super weird but I had something to think about for the rest of the day. I came upon a backcountry campsite with bear lockers once my legs started to tire, so I set up camp there, and watched the sunset from my hammock.

<img src="images\day4-chillin.jpg" alt="Action shot!" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">The extra weight and space that the hammock took up was definitely worth it</p>
There was the occasional car that visited the day use area, but as the sun set, everyone packed up and left, and for the first time this trip, I'd be sleeping completely alone in the middle of nowhere. This started out as distressing but slowly became peaceful instead after thinking of all the precautions I was taking to avoid wildlife. I had a storage bin far away from my tent for my food and I had bear spray and the sat phone with me in the tent. Before sleeping, I took one last walk around the site to watch the last bit of sunlight leave the sky.
***Note: In the first bit of the trip, my activity recordings are quite segmented and don't include the entire day because I didn't use the 'resume later' feature on my watch. it gets better!***

## Day 5 - Somewhere in the Spray Valley to Elkford (Far too long)
This day had a ton of great views so it's a bit of a photo dump.

I was woken up by the sound of footsteps in the morning, so I got out of my sleeping bag, trying to make as little noise as possible, and peeked out of the tent. I was greeted with this elk about 30m away just trotting through the parking lot!

<img src="images\day5-elk.jpg" alt="" width="50%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">Who needs alarms</p>
It was time to pack up, I wanted to get an early start since I had a long day ahead. I took some time to have breakfast by the pond.

<img src="images\day5-morningducks.jpg" alt="" width="50%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">Misty morning!</p>
At this point, I felt like I really nailed packing up the bike. My hubris was quickly dampened after I looked back and saw the drawstring on the top of my saddlebag was snapped and my flip-flops were missing. Luckily I only had to go back 1 km to find both flip-flops. I secured them a little better, then I was on my way. Aside from that small hiccup, this morning was incredibly peaceful.

<img src="images\day5-bike.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">'Makeout Point'</p>
The climbs were manageable and the descents were flowy, even with bags strapped to the bike. After about three hours of riding, I finally saw other bikers doing the same trail so I joined them for a bit.

<img src="images\day5-bridge.jpg" alt="" width="50%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">I walked my bike across this</p>
After this super wobbly bridge, I had a super fun descent to the Kananaskis Lakes, where I took a 2 hour lunch break. It felt good to cover 35km before noon.

<img src="images\day5-view.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">View right before Kananaskis Lakes</p>
According to my map, I had roughly 70km left, with 10km of climbing followed by 60km of descent. The climb up elk pass was wonderful, it was very lush and green.

<img src="images\day5-butterfly.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">The butterflies really liked my gloves!</p>

The top of the pass had this gateway built, which marked the Alberta-British Columbia border. 
<img src="images\day5-elkvalley.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">I'm in BC, the camera is in AB</p>

The next 5km of the trail was one of the most memorable moments of the trip. Since I was so high up, the views were much more grand.
<img src="images\day5-elkvalley2.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Elk Valley is absolutely beautiful!</p>

I had this view to look at while I travelled 30 km/h effortlessly going downhill. I had to stop a few times to savour the view since I knew it wouldn't last. After this main downhill, the rest of the valley was a bit of a slog. I was finishing the last bit of the food I had while realizing I severely miscalculated the distance between Kananaskis Lakes and Elkford. Instead of the 100km day I was expecting, I was in for 130km. I grit my teeth through the last bit of the valley dreaming of the food I'd get once in Elkford. When I rolled into town however, every restaurant was closed! I forgot small towns tend to close down early. Luckily, the liquor store was still open and carried snacks, so after biking 130km, I scarfed down a bag of chips and a few pieces of jerky.

## Day 6 - Elkford to Fernie (80 km)
I woke up starving after the previous day, but unfortunately, the town of Elkford doesn't do breakfast so I had more chips to start the day. For the first time during this trip, the heat wasn't terribly oppressive and the sun was shielded by the clouds.

<img src="images\day6-road.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">I usually hate overcast, but it was pretty nice this morning</p>
I gunned it to Sparwood to get myself a nice burger, the first real meal for a couple of days. The burger raised my spirits a little but while I was taking a super long lunch break, the sun came back out and the temperatures soared again. That definitely slowed down the second half of this day. Sparwood and Fernie are connected by a 40km length of wonderful singletrack, so even if it was hot, the trail was fun.
<img src="images\day6-building.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">Idk what this building was for but there was a basement I didn't feel brave enough to explore</p>
<img src="images\day6-view.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
When I got into town I had some fish and chips and stocked up on food. I stayed at the Mt Fernie provincial park and although I had to pay for a site, the showers were much needed and the bear bins gave me peace of mind.

## Day 7 - Fernie to Kikomun Creek Prov. Park (80 km)
I've been here before for mountain biking and I was floating the idea of going for a morning bike ride without my bags on the nearby trails. But after waking up with sore legs, I let the idea slide and went on with the trip instead. I headed into town and had some Big Bang Bagels for breakfast/lunch (very good bagels btw), and waited for the chocolate shop to open so I could complete Dave's quest of delivering chocolate to Jay. At the chocolate shop, I asked for recommendations and crowd favorites since it was for a gift. After hearing that, the shop owner asked if it was for Jay! So I got recommended Jay's favorite chocolate and brought it to him at the bike shop next door. After that, I was on my way out of Fernie. The trails near the town were super flowy and well maintained. I got a warned of a black bear up the trail from an oncoming biker so I kept my eyes and ears open for the next little bit. A little bit of rain started to fall which was very welcome as it cleared a bit of the smoke out of the sky. About an hour out of the town, I came upon a dog standing in the middle of the path ahead, looking right at me.

<img src="images\day7-dog.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

I stopped for a bit and it eventually went back along the path so I continued on. After turning a corner, I heard a bunch of barking and I saw at least 10 dogs all looking at me, wagging their tails. I stopped on the side of the trail to say hi to all the dogs as the owner walked by.

The trails started getting rougher as I got further from Fernie and the single track eventually kicked me out onto a combination of logging and fire roads. I took a break in Elko to get some sugary drinks and snacks. Right after Elko, the vegetation changed drastically. The leaf filled green forests were replaced by dry yellow grass and Jack Pines. I saw that there was a campsite in the Kikomun Creek Provincial Park so I made that my destination for the day. I set up camp right next to Lake Koocanusa, had my freeze dried dinner that I picked up in Fernie, and read in my hammock till the sun set.
<img src="images\day7-sunset.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

## Day 8 - Kikomun Creek Prov. Park to Cranbrook (75 km)
At this point in the trip, I was still considering quitting due to the smoke. It wasn't too bad where I was but it was only going to get worse as I got further into BC. I wasn't sure where I was going to draw the line so I just packed up and got going in the morning. The first 15 kilometers of the day went super quick since it was on the road. I was really craving coffee this morning and luckily, there was a campsite with a general store along the road where I could pick some up. I was really hoping that there would be a store at Wardner, halfway between my start and end point of the day, but unfortunately there wasn't. I have never craved sweet drinks more than I have during this trip.
<img src="images\day8-actionshot.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">I was trying not to think about how much more I had left in the day but the kilometer markers along this trail told me exactly how far I went every 4 minutes</p>
I ran into a couple of bikepackers going the opposite way as me, and they told me the smoke wasn't too bad up ahead, so my hopes for the rest of the trip were raised!

<img src="images\day8-deer.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">There's a deer here, you just have to look closely</p>
The day was pretty uneventful otherwise, I had an early stop at Cranbrook and relaxed in a hotel for the rest of the evening.

## Day 9 - Cranbrook to Some Bridge close to St Mary Lake (70 km)
The best part of sleeping in motels was not the warm bed, or the AC, or the shower. It was not having to pack up your sleeping gear onto the bike in the morning. Even if I feel like I was hustling, packing took me at least an hour. So after a nice complementary breakfast, I was out nice and early and on my way to Kimberley. The Cranbrook to Kimberley pathway was an old railgrade that is now paved over, so even though I was climbing, a 1% grade is hardly noticable
<img src="images\day9-bike.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
The smoke got much much worse today so I was taking lots of pictures thinking it could be the end of the trip.
<img src="images\day9-sudowoodo.jpg" alt="" width="50%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
I was very indecisive about whether or not to continue once I got to Kimberley, so I took a lunch break to think about it. I decided that as long as I am taking it easy and the smoke isn't bothering me, I would keep going. Me mum did not like that choice very much but I think it was the right one.
<img src="images\day9-graycreekpass.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
After leaving Kimberley, the Gray Creek Pass begins! This infamous section of the trail climbs over 1400m, but I knew I wasn't going to tackle it today. I took it slow for the rest of the day and stopped for a snack at the very windy St Mary Lake.
<img src="images\day9-smokylake.jpg" alt="" width="80%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
After this break, I went for another hour till I found the perfect campsite next to a creek. There were a couple of campers set up nearby as well. The hammock was once again well worth it as I had some tea while reading as dusk set in.

## Day 10 - Some Bridge close to St Mary Lake to Kokanee Creek Prov. Park (80 km)
After a good rest, I felt ready to tackle Gray Creek Pass. As I was packing my bags up in the morning, I noticed a biker going up the pass as well. I rushed to finish packing and biked quickly up the first bit of the pass. I eventually caught up and we chatted for a bit. His name was Sean and he was in Calgary for the stampede. Instead of driving back with his partner, he decided to take it as an opportunity to do the TCT from Banff to Vancouver. We continued up the pass together, which was made a little easier with company.
<img src="images\day10-creek.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">There were lots of spots to fill up water along the road</p>
After 3 hours of some biking and some bike pushing, we made it to the top! I took a longer break to have some lunch while Sean continued down the other side of the pass. While eating lunch, I ran into more bikepackers coming the opposite way again! We had lunch together and told each other of the trails ahead. Seeing all these bikepackers made me incredibly confident in the rest of the journey.

The ride down the pass was incredibly fast. I covered 25 kilometers in under an hour, and lost all the elevation I worked so hard to gain.

I took a long break at Crawford Bay to eat some early dinner and read for a couple of hours. After this break, I made my way to the free Ferry across Kootenay Lake.

<img src="images\day10-ferry.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

I found another provincial park along the way, and once again, the showers and bear lockers were well worth the cost of a site.

## Day 11 - Kokanee Creek Prov. Park to Trail (110 km)
I got an early start to the day, and with the paved road between me and Nelson, I covered ground quickly. Biking on the shoulder of the road got to be a little unnerving as the road was quite windy, but most drivers slowed down and gave lots of room as they passed.

<p style="text-align: center;">This road is a lot steeper than it looks!</p>
I was in Nelson the year before as part of a road trip and it was one of my favorite towns, so I was excited to have made it there. I stopped at a cafe for breakfast and took extra time to bike through downtown Nelson after I was done. The TCT took me through the steep hills of Nelson and onto another section of railgrade trail. Once again, even though I was climbing, the 1% grade was hardly noticable.

There were plenty of ponds and wetlands along this section of the trail, which made the air noticably humid. That paired with the heat made getting to Salmo a bit of a slog. After getting to Salmo, I went straight to the cafe to get some late lunch and a cold drink. The cafe was packed with people in some interesting clothes, so I did some googling while waiting for my food and found that the Shambhala music festival just south of Salmo ended that afternoon. If only I made it to Salmo two days earlier.

The long lunches I've been taking turned into a pattern, even if I didn't realize it before today. With the high temperatues during this trip, biking from 2 to 4 pm is pretty much impossible, so I've just been using those hours to rest instead.

After Salmo, a lot of the TCT went along the shoulder of the highway or minor paved roads, which allowed me to cover a lot of distance. This was the first day that I felt that my fitness was improving, so the extra distance didn't feel too difficult.

I got a motel in Trail, ordered a pizza, and watched some TV before crashing after a long day.

## Day 12 - Trail to Christina Lake (100 km)
After closely watching the smoke forecast, I decided it would be best to not follow the TCT and go through Castlegar. Instead, I planned to go through Rossland and reconnect with the TCT at Paulson. The smoke was quite bad in Trail this morning as well so I biked most of the morning with a mask on.

<p style="text-align: center;">I got a little lost looking for the right way through these trails</p>
12 km from Trail, I got to Rossland. Right at the edge of the town, someone was standing on their balcony and waved. We talked for a bit and she told me the best way to get into the city that avoided any steep hills. In town, I stocked up on food.

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
Unfortunately, this alternate route included more than 50km of biking on the shoulder on a road that was not too quiet. I grit my teeth through most of the road biking since I wanted to get it done with as soon as possible.
<img src="images\day12-summit.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
After two passes and almost a kilometer of climbing, I reconnected with the TCT. I found an old campsite to take a break at and sat around for a couple of hours.

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
Just as I was leaving, another bikepacker pulled up to this spot to spend the night. He came from Castlegar and said the smoke was manageable. The rest of the day had some pretty easy biking, it was downhill at a shallow grade so I could pedal lightly and still travel quick.

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
After the long break earlier in the day I felt energetic so I kept biking along until sunset was near, then I started looking out for campsites. I found a nice spot near Cascade Falls where I found a nice and sandy spot. By the time I was done setting up, it was almost completely dark out, my timing was perfect!

## Day 13 - Christina Lake to Rock Creek (98 km)
I woke up with a huge headache, feeling like I barely slept at all. I'm fortunate enough to get headaches rarely and I'm fortunate enough to have my headaches removed fairly quickly when I take tylenol. I had some tylenol with me that I took while packing up, but by the time I was finished, the headache only got worse. Well, there was nothing to do but keep 'er going. I drank some extra water and took it very easy this morning. While biking along, my front wheel felt like it kept washing out, even though the gravel trail was packed well. It took me longer than I'd like to admit to figure out that I had a flat on my front wheel! I had service and plenty of tools, so after some searching I figured out that tubeless sealant can lose effectiveness with time. I put some new sealant in the tire and I was good to go. I made it to Grand Forks, just a little bit too late to get the eggs and bacon breakfast I was craving, so I ordered a chicken sandwich instead. I almost passed out while waiting for the food, I made it to my chair before my vision went completely dark. I took a breather, got it together, then went back to the coffee stand to dump a ton of sugar into my cup. This made me feel much better. The sandwich revived me a little as well, but I still didn't feel 100%.

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
I continued slowly and steadily out of Grand Forks and about 20 km later, I stumbled upon this old shed.
<img src="images\day13-shed.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
Since I wasn't feeling too great, I took an hour to relax in the shed and read before continuing again. A biker came by and joined me for a bit. He lived in Grand Forks and we exchanged stories for a while until he needed to head back home. I stayed a little longer then got back to it

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
This part of the TCT had plenty of tunnels which I loved to see. They were always a little spooky, but ultimately fun.
<img src="images\day13-traillog.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;">There were lots of trail logs along the TCT with plenty of information for trail users and logs that usually went back at least 10 years</p>
The morning was a bit of a blur but in the late afternoon I started to feel much better. I was going to stop in Greenwood but decided to press on until my legs got too tired or it got too dark.
<img src="images\day13-green.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
I was running into a lot of dogs along this stretch, but all of them were friendly and joined me in my journey for a minute or so.
<img src="images\day13-deer.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
About 20 km out of Greenwood, I started to keep my eyes out for camp sites. All the land here was private and I prefered a spot on crown land. So I kept going and got off my bike to scope out sites every now and then.
<img src="images\day13-kvr.jpg" alt="" width="60%"/>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
I got to the town of Rock Creek by the time the sun was completely set. There was a motel with a pub that I was very tempted to drop a bunch of money at, but I got a motel not long ago and couldn't justify it. There was also a campsite but it appeared to be full. So I put on my headlamp and kept going. The trail went along a creek, and I eventually found a path that led down to the creek and dragged my bike down. After all the dust from the trail today, I had to take a dunk in the creek, so I got that over with before unpacking my bike and setting up camp. It was pitch black out by the time I was done setting up camp and eating, so setting up the bear hang was a bit of a challenge.
