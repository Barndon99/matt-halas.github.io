In November 2020, after one (1) month of snow, I was dreaming of summer. Unfortunately, since it was only November, I'd have to wait 5 months before it would be nice and warm out again. So until then, my only option was to experience summer vicariously through youtube videos. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3O3ooTtrV4){:target="_blank"} came up on my feed so I watched it over the course of a few days while eating lunch. The Great Divide Mountain Bike Route (Banff, AB to the Mexico border) has been on my bucket list for a couple years and this video seemed to capture the experience so well. After watching the video, I knew I wanted to do a similar trip in the summer. So I started planning and I started dreaming of the upcoming trip!
## The Route
I've never done a bikepacking trip before so I wasn't about to make the GDMBR my first trip. I wanted to do something big though, so I browsed [bikepacking.com](https://www.bikepacking.com){:target="_blank"} for inspiration. After a road trip through southern BC in the previous year, I was wanting to go back, so the [BC Trail](https://bikepacking.com/routes/bc-trail/){:target="blank"} seemed like a great choice! After some more searching, I found that the [Trans Canada Trail](https://tctrail.ca/explore-the-map/){:target="blank"}(TCT) overlaps with the entire BC Trail, so I based my route off that. I decided I would leave from my house in Calgary, AB, and finish my trip at Stanley Park in Vancouver, BC.

## Planning and Gear
I read somewhere on Reddit that the best bike for bikepacking is the bike you own. I own two bikes, a Jamis Ventura road bike, and Trek Fuel mountain bike. I should have listened, but I was dead set on using a hardtail for this trip since most bikepacking videos I've seen had only hardtails or rigid bikes. My friend has a hard tail that he hasn't used for a while, so he let me borrow his Giant Talon.

<p style="text-align: center;">The Giant Talon Packed up on Day 1</p>
Originally, I wanted to use a panier for the extra storage space, but the mounting would be a pain to set up so I went with the ol' reliable saddle bag. I also bought a frame bag (small enough to leave space for a water bottle), top tube bag (waterproof for electronics), and a dry bag for the handlebars. I wish I got a picture of all my gear layed out before packing (those pictures are so cool!), but I'll make sure to get that for my next trip.

I didn't want to hold myself to a schedule, so I got a good idea of where I could camp along the route and planned to stop whenever I felt that I had enough for the day. I carried a sat phone with me that I could use to check in with me mum whenever I was starting/stopping for the day.

## Day 1 - Calgary to Bragg Creek (71 km)
My friend Austin joined me for the first day, so after leaving, I biked the familiar route between our houses to pick him up. It was about 35<sup>o</sup>C when I left, so walking into Austin's air conditioned home after 20 minutes of biking made me reconsider what I was about to do. I quickly pushed that thought aside, helped Austin load up his bike, and we were on route to Bragg Creek! The route I chose for this day deviates from the Trans Canada Trail, as I didn't want to go all the way north to Cochrane just to come back down south to Bragg Creek. This was the only day that was 100% road, so I chose the least busy roads between Calgary and Bragg Creek and took those.

This route took us through rural communities and hilly ranchlands. Very hilly ranchlands. We made distance a bit slower than expected but finally made it into Bragg Creek as dusk was creeping in. We still had light to set up the tent, but we ate in the dark. I spent a good 20 minutes trying to get the bear hang set up, but after that, we were out.

## Day 2 - Bragg Creek to Barrier Lake (52 km)
The sun shining through the tent wall makes it quite difficult to sleep in. So even if we could've used a few more hours of sleep, we packed up and headed over to the town of Bragg Creek for breakfast.

I wouldn't have another spot to get food until well into day 3, so I stocked up on peanut butter, canned tuna, chocolate, pepperoni, and any other dense foods I could find. Austin biked with me to the West Bragg Creek trailhead and we waited for his mom to pick him up there. From this point on, I'd be leaving the road and biking on trails.

I was starting to get a little nervous about being on my own on the trails here, but excitement took over once I got biking. There were some super muddy sections of the trail here which made the travelling extremely slow.

The official TCT goes over Cox Hill, which would add another 900m of elevation to my already tired legs, so I chose to ride around it instead. I still had to go up a pass to get to Barrier Lake, and after a few hours of pushing my bike through mud and up hills, I found I was taking breaks every 5 minutes until I had to eventually sit down. This made me realize I barely ate anything since breakfast and this was but a "bonk". I had a few spoons of peanut butter, read The Alchemist for 15 minutes, and I was good to go again! I got to the top of Lusk Pass, the trail started to flatten out, and I was getting excited for the downhill. Then my back wheel went over a rock, slipped, and I found I could not pedal anymore.

<p style="text-align: center;">The poor derailleur</p>
Oh lordy. This was not good. The derailleur was completely trashed. I tried running the chain through just the front chainring and cassette, but with no tension from the derailleur, it kept slipping as I went over bumps on the downhill. I kept imagining what I'd do to get myself out of this and keep the trip going. Canmore was still so far away and there's no way I'd do that entire stretch on one gear with a chain that slips every minute. I contemplated quitting a couple of times. But after calming down, and thinking the situation through, I decided that the Giant Talon would be a no-go for the rest of the trip. I asked me mum to bring my Trek Fuel to Barrier Lake, 45 mintues outside of Calgary. Luckily, she was okay with it. The trip was saved! While waiting at Barrier Lake, I ate some dinner, went for a swim, and had an hour to relax after all the biking and bike issues. I moved all my bags over to the new bike, asked a biker in the parking lot for a shock pump to make up for the extra weight of the bags, and was off to find a campsite on the south side of Barrier Lake.
